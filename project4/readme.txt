I have successfully differentiated F mode, O mode and sV mode 
Steps:
1. Created a dictionary with key as number and values acts as flag where 1 is F mode, 2 is O mode and so on.
2. Created a condition for each mode and when it satisfies the flag in the dictionary becomes '1' and then reset to '0' after  the IP address and time is printed on the text file.
